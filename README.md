Register user is functional, but due to time constraints, the ability to add a shoe to one's collection wasn't completely functional. However, the ability to edit details within one's shoe collection is possible on the shoe's given page. See below:

## Acknowledgements 
Hoping the work I put forth illustrates that I met all the requirements this quarter. There were many hurdles to overcome, but I felt that the web application is still something I should be proud of with the time I was able to put in. 

Thank you, Professor Kubiak!
